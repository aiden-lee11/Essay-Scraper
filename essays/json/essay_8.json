    "Essay": "My head was contorted to the left in a painful, awkward position in which the tip of my head brushed the top of my chest.  It was as if a puppeteer had gained control of my now jerky, wooden-like legs ; I could not walk without aid. My whole body was so weak that simple movements like lifting a glass of water exhausted me. Therefore, I had to be fed, bathed, and clothed as if I was an infant. My speech was extremely slurred and incomprehensible. The physical problems were not what destroyed me the most, however; my mental cognition was severely inhibited. I could not successfully read, write, or even keep up with simple plots of television shows. Everything moved too fast for me.  I\u2019d just finished learning about complex trig identities, and I now couldn't even count to ten! I\u2019d developed a sudden, severe, rare form of dystonia just after my junior prom, but I have never believed in the quote  \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u201d  more than during my miraculous recovery, which revealed that my illness occurred to encourage me to stretch my supposed limitations in life\u2019s journey. My high school principal froze my grades where they were at, but my mother had to contact the college I was dual enrolled with to extend the time to take my French and trig finals. I\u2019d doubted I could even pass my finals due to my current cognitive state. My friends and family held back tears when they visited me. Their eyes stared at my stark white neck brace and awkward limbs, and their ears strained to comprehend my unintelligible speech.  I did not react. I could not react.  I felt like an empty shell of a human because I could not feel any kind of emotion\u2014happiness, anger, fear, or sadness. I was simply being. Precious values my parents instilled in me\u2013to maintain my faith and to crave the expansion of my knowledge\u2013 were gone. Prescribed medicine relieved my pain, but the various neurologists I\u2019d seen could not determine how long I would be in this state;  I believed God wanted me to be mentally and physically handicapped for the rest of my life . Then one day, after many hazy days of nothingness and being unaware of the passage of time, my mother asked me morosely if I would like to enroll in an online school or drop out of school altogether since my condition was not improving. Her words echoed in my mind, and I was immediately drawn out of my vegetative state because I was horrified at the potential reality of my dreams being crushed from something I had no control over.  I refused to accept my supposed fate. I was the one thing in life I had control over. Every day, I exercised my legs by taking my dogs outside, checking the mailbox, and walking around my room. Instead of watching new shows or reading books, since I could not keep up, I watched movies that I\u2019d regularly watched to practice reading subtitles and interpreting information.  Who would\u2019ve thought that Walt Disney\u2019s Tarzan and Pixar\u2019s Bee Movie would be some of the most vital tools  of my healing process? For my trig class, numbers appeared to be Latin. However, after many weeks, I finally was able to solve problems and learn at the original rate I did before I got sick. As for French, I studied it every day to combat my weakened recall. Eventually, towards the end of the summer, I took my finals and aced them, and this success encouraged me to continue to strive for more successes, varying from learning new French words every day to starting my own music business. From my sickness,  I realized that even the darkest points of your life occur for a reason, and any success begins with a powerful, true sense of self-determination .",
    "Review": "B Satisfactory The essay is written competently and demonstrates a reasonable display of ideas and genuine personality. The writing style is functional but may not be as compelling as other essays. It is likely to be considered adequately by the admissions committee. Learn about how we evaluate essays \u2192",
    "Positive_Feedback": "Topic Deals With Struggle : Some of the best essay topics are dealing with challenges you've faced, because difficulties make it easier to reflect upon what you've learned. Admissions officers ultimately are looking for self-growth, and showing how you've handled personal challenges can demonstrate your new understandings as a result. However, avoid talking about \"tragedy\" or difficulty without a clear purpose. Don't write about it because you think \"you should,\" only write about challenges if they are true to yourself and you have something meaningful and unique to say about them. Otherwise, it can come off as trying to garner sympathy (i.e. \"sob stories\") which admissions officers generally dislike. Uses Showing, Not Telling : More convincing than telling admissions officers, is presenting them with \"evidence\" and allowing them to come to the conclusion themselves. If you want to show the idea \"I couldn't learn due to this condition,\" it is far more effective to do what this student did and say, \"I'd just finished learning complex trig identities, and I now couldn't even count to ten.\"  When drafting, it is normal and okay to start off with more \"telling\" as you get your ideas on paper. But as your essay progresses, you should transform those moments of \"telling\" into more powerful and convincing moments of \"showing.\"",
    "Negative_Feedback": "Surface-Level Takeaways : Having meaningful reflections is a critical part of having compelling essays. But make sure your takeaways are not surface-level or generic. Each admissions officer has likely read thousands of essays, so they are well aware of the common ideas and tropes. Avoid clich\u00e9 ideas at all costs, because it comes across as forgettable and unoriginal. Instead, it is okay to start with surface-level ideas, but keep asking yourself probing questions like \"Why\" and \"How\" to push your ideas deeper. Weak Conclusion : This essay tells a nice story of overcoming their physical impediment, but ultimately lacks meaningful reflections in the conclusion. Too much time is spent on \"the problem\" and not enough on how they overcame it. Your conclusion should have your best, most compelling ideas in your entire essay. Try ending your essay by connecting to the beginning with a new perspective, expanding on your idea with a new takeaway, or connecting to broader, more universal themes. Avoid having a conclusion that \"sounds nice,\" but ultimately is lacking in meaningful content."
