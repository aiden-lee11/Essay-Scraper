    "Essay": "His eyes stared back at me with contentment. Neither he nor I,  the baby girl on his lap , are smiling, but there is a sense of peace, of quiet happiness about us. I hold his wrist in one hand, my other grasping a bottle of ketchup. He holds my tiny leg and my waist, propping me up. His wedding band gleams in the midafternoon sunlight. That same ring catches the light in my bedroom, the bedroom he painted yellow when I was still the baby in the photo. My mother gave it to me for my sixteenth birthday, and it flashes purple when I move my hand. Staring at my reflection in the ring\u2019s surface, I can still see the baby girl in the photo. I have the same round face, the same brown, almond-shaped eyes. For the first time, I have something tangible to remind me of him --  something more substantial than our shared love of puns or 16-year-old photographs that curl at the corners. That picture has stayed the same for 16 years. My dad passed away before I took my first steps.  I have no conscious memories of him.  My mother did her best to make my childhood as normal as possible, but my dad\u2019s loss still hurts.  It is a strange feeling not to know what my own father\u2019s favorite color was or what foods he liked. I was most fascinated by my mother\u2019s stories of his career. Driven by a desire to emulate him, I decided I wanted to prosecute corporate tax fraud for the IRS, as he had done. If I was unable to know him, choosing his career path felt like the most substantial connection I had to him.  I wanted to  make him proud to be my father. For much of my life, my dad\u2019s most discernible presence came through Social Security survivor benefits or checks from his pension fund, supporting our family and compensating for my mom\u2019s sporadic employment. My health insurance was provided through Medicaid. These programs leveled the socioeconomic playing field so that my family had one less thing to worry about.  So we could afford to focus our limited finances on things like extracurricular activities or saving money to further my education. Slowly, my desire to become an attorney became less about becoming my father. The older I have grown, the more I have realized the necessity of programs like Medicaid and Social Security, how changes in entitlement programs affect the everyday lives of Americans dependent on them: if Medicaid suffered cuts or my pediatrician\u2019s accepted forms of insurance changed,  I went months at a time unable to see a doctor.  Through this experience, I discovered a passion for civil rights law. I want to aid others in danger of losing the same programs that have been instrumental to my success -- to help those that need additional advantages to gain the same opportunities as their peers. Even many of my close friends do not ask why I wear the same ring every day; I keep the story personal.  Writing about my dad is difficult.  I rarely talk about him with anyone, even my family. I prefer my ring to be a silent symbol of our relationship. Our connection is intimate, and sharing the ways that I feel his presence in my day-to-day life makes me feel exposed.  I have never written in this much depth about the ways losing my dad has affected me. Addressing my greatest vulnerability has forced me to think about the example my dad set for me, despite being unable to play the role in my life he deserved. His legacy helped me form my greatest aspirations.  Embodied in my story is the story of someone I barely remember, yet has inspired me more than anyone , someone who has  given me so many traits  that have made me the person I am today.",
    "Review": "B + Good The essay is well-written and demonstrates a satisfactory display of ideas and genuine personality. The writing style is competent but may not be as engaging as other essays. It is likely to be considered favorably by the admissions committee. Learn about how we evaluate essays \u2192",
    "Positive_Feedback": "Navigates Tragedy Gracefully : Writing about a tragedy like a loss of a parent is a tricky topic for college essays. Many students feel obligated to choose that topic if it applies to them, but it can be challenging to not come across as trying to garner sympathy (\"sob story\"). This student does a graceful job of focusing on positive elements from their father's legacy, particularly the inspiration they draw from him. Compelling Motivations : This student does a great job of connecting their educational and career aspirations to their background. Admissions officers want to understand why you're pursing what you are, and by explaining the origin of your interests, you can have compelling and genuine reasons why.",
    "Negative_Feedback": "Write Only From Your Perspective : In this essay, the student writes from their hypothetical perspective as an infant. This doesn't quite work because they likely wouldn't remember these moments (\"I have no conscious memories of him\"), but still writes as though they do. By writing about things you haven't seen or experienced yourself, it can come across as \"made up\" or inauthentic."
