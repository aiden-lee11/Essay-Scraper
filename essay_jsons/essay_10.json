    "Essay": "I was still high off the competition, poring over ballots by the soft streetlights as we drove. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d My Dad was worried about me. Worried about my world crashing down around me, losing friends, being crushed by hate. Scarred by controversy. I laughed it off, and we rode in silence. Forgive the melodrama: this is a story about being a dissident in an authoritarian regime, but it\u2019s a fun story.  From 12 years old, I grew up in the NCFCA\u2014the National Christian Forensics and Communication Association, a homeschool speech and debate league. My friends and I joked that  the only difference between fascist Italy and the NCFCA is that in Italy, things at least ran on time.  But this is how my political awakening began: a summer debate camp in  [Date]  that my parents sent me to because I \u201calways argued.\u201d  I was hooked. Politically, the NCFCA is conservative.  Not totally homogenous , but Christian and homeschooled. At the same time I was learning debate\u2014how to think\u2014in that context,  my Dad  and I started watching  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  and talking about its subjects. This duality was key: as I developed my own, left-leaning views, I was surrounded by  very  smart people who disagreed with me. I had instant access to  the best arguments against my beliefs\u2014instant access to the best tools to refine them.  Beyond that, though, it imparted empathy: seeing a wide range of views held by people that I liked and respected  (and still do)  made me want to understand. I loved it. Fast forward to my second or third year in the league. I wanted to have some fun. I emailed the regional coordinator, asking if there\u2019s a rule against a speech advocating for same-sex marriage. The answer?  \u201cNo, but people wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d  That was fine.  That was the point . Why do a persuasive speech if everyone already agrees with you?  The first draft of the speech was straightforward: establish the separation of church and state, then outline the secular arguments for gay marriage.  Watching everything from disgust to bemusement play across my club members\u2019 faces as I gave the speech , hearing the note of concern that didn\u2019t quite mask the edge creeping into the critique, I tried again. I built a theological argument, established common ground with my audience, and I was going to persuade them. I never got the chance. A couple months before competition season began, we were pulled aside at club. The hushed tones, the guarded expressions\u2014the room was heavy with quiet, administrative displeasure. It wasn\u2019t a two-sided conversation. They told me two things: I couldn\u2019t give the speech in club  (because controversy has no place in a  debate club !), and the national leadership decided my speech didn\u2019t reflect a Biblical worldview.  Meaning? Banned speech. After writing a flurry of ultimately ineffective emails, I did a speech on why we should embrace theological diversity. That speech wasn\u2019t fueled by spite\u2014though I do enjoy the irony of its birth, and I sarcastically named the word document \u201cHERESY.\u201d Rather, I wanted to make a point.  Christian Abolitionism, the Nicene Creed, the doctrine of the Trinity: all once hotly debated products of dissent, iron sharpening iron.  Of history\u2019s  40,000+  competing theologies, why assume that you\u2019ve come along and finally gotten the Bible right?  I didn\u2019t do well with this speech, but I still won : because I am unbroken\u2014not scarred, but emboldened. I saw intolerance, but I also see hope. To this day, some of my closest friendships are built upon discussions of theology and politics,  iron on iron, punctuated by laughter. Hope lives in that laughter , because as it dances between us, it brings with it empathy and wisdom.",

    "Positive_Feedback": "Reflects Meaningfully and Deeply : This essay has lots of interesting ideas about having discussions between people of different viewpoints. This student is able to reflect sincerely about what the benefit of that dialogue is (\"iron sharpening iron\") and able to draw meaningful conclusions (\"hope lives in that laughter\") that express deeper ideas. By focusing on these compelling reflections, this student shows themself as a brilliant and thoughtful thinker, while demonstrating what they value: discourse between opposing viewpoints. Rather than focusing on the literal happenings (i.e. giving a speech to their club), the student reflects on what that experience represents more broadly, which allows them to connect to deeper ideas. Specific And Vivid References : This essay is full of details, without being wordy or drawn out. Even small details like naming the show \"The Daily Show\" or giving a number of \"40,000+ theologies\" makes their writing much more engaging and compelling. By avoiding broad and vague language, this student paints a fascinating picture that allows the reader to enter their world. It is always better to be specific than to be generic, but make sure that the specific details are always relevant to your point. This essay is a great example of how to do both. Shows Strong Sense of Personality : This essay does a fantastic job of creating a \"voice.\" That is, you can easily imagine the student as if they were speaking to you while reading it. To craft this voice, this student uses small moments of more informal language and interjecting remarks that show their thought process. Using parentheses can be a good way to show your voice by jumping in when you have a small remark to add. This student also demonstrates a sense of humor and lightheartedness while still discussing meaningful ideas. The sarcastic remark \"because controversy has no place in a debate club!\" demonstrates their values (of dialogue between differing viewpoints) as well as showing their sense of personality.",
    "Negative_Feedback": "Unnecessary Intro Paragraph : This essay's weakest point is its intro or \"hook.\" In fact, it could work much better by excluding the introduction paragraph and starting off with the second paragraph: \"Forgive the melodrama: this is a story...\" That short phrase is much more captivating and immediately draws the reader in. The introduction paragraph in this essay is too much of a meandering and vague story: you don't know what they're talking about, and ultimately it doesn't matter. Rather than using a fancy story or descriptions to introduce your essay, try jumping into the \"meat\" of your essay immediately. Consider using a short, declarative sentence or phrase like \"Forgive the melodrama\" as a hook, which is more impactful and draws the reader immediately into your essay."
