    "Essay": "As I left home last July to fly  nearly 5,000 miles  to summer camp in the Pacific Northwest, it felt easier than ever before. Not only had I made the trip each summer since the age of 12, but I had been newly promoted from camper to counselor-in-training (CT), and the prospective change of role filled me with anticipation. My CT summer last year was by far my most memorable.  I finally had the opportunity to impact the lives of the next generation of campers in the same way my own counselors had impacted mine;  however, this chance was equally exhilarating and daunting. While it did motivate me to excel at my job and present the best of myself,  it also made me increasingly aware of my perceived shortcomings , especially after witnessing many of my peers thrive in their new roles.  One became  a prominent and well-respected basketball coach, having played at an elite level all through high school, while another was especially gifted at looking after the youngest children, having helped her father raise her siblings back home. Compared to their successes,  I struggled to maintain self-confidence as I did not know if my effort was being equally well-received  by the campers.   However, one thing I was proud of by the midpoint of the session was the close friendship I had struck up and nurtured with  one of the older campers  while teaching his sailing class. This build up of trust culminated in him visiting my table one lunchtime and handing me a crumpled sliver of red paper, before scurrying away with a bashful grin. There is a strong tradition at camp of writing heartfelt letters to those for whom you are grateful, and this was one such note. Upon reading it that evening I collapsed onto my bunk,  overcome with emotion.  I lay there reflecting and reminiscing until late at night, before delicately tucking the paper into my journal. It detailed not only how I had greatly impacted and improved his camp experience, but that \u2018I had become like a brother to him\u2019, which  I quote from the letter that is pinned to my bedroom wall even now. From that moment, my attitude for the rest of the session was markedly more confident, as I had received the assurance I was lacking.  I channeled this confidence into teaching, working with the campers, and also into my personal relationships.  After thanking my friend for the note, we further connected in an especially memorable conversation, where I shared some of my biggest fears surrounding loneliness,  deteriorating friendships with my high school friends, and terrifying upcoming changes in my own life, such as moving abroad for college . In return, he entrusted me with his feelings about his troubled relationship with his parents and how that had affected his mental health, which he later admitted was the first time he had shared that. The assurance and confidence I gained from the summer did not desert me once I returned home. For one, the practical skills I had gained through counseling made my job as a diving coach far easier, as I had more experience teaching and  thus better understood how to productively and positively interact with the young divers.  However, the biggest change was in my attitude towards the future. While I confided in my friend about my fear of moving away from the familiarity of home during the summer,  upon further consideration it no longer fills me with the same sort of apprehension.  The  confidence and maturity I nurtured while at camp will continue to serve me well as I move into the next stage of my life.",

    "Positive_Feedback": "Shows Interaction With Others : This essay has a heartfelt moment where the author connects deeply with a camper and feels a sense of genuine gratitude. By showing their newfound connection with a person they were mentoring, this creates a sense of humanity and also tells a lot about the author themself. By talking about other people in your life, you create a literary \"foil\" which in turn describes something about yourself. Showing how you interact with others can be telling into your character, such as showing your empathy, sense of humor, friendliness, or how you draw inspiration from others. Shows Vulnerability and Self-Awareness : This essay does a good job of expressing vulnerability, specifically the author's fears about the future and \"deteriorating friendships\" after going to college. By being vulnerable, these moments feel more relatable to the reader. Showing your struggles (especially emotional ones) can also make your later \"successes\" feel more impactful when you show how you've overcame them or persist in face of those struggles. By recognizing your flaws or insecurities, you also show self-awareness, which is a positive trait because you need to be self-aware in order to improve the areas of yourself you want to fix.",
    "Negative_Feedback": "Lacks Deep And Nuanced Reflection : Although this essay does reflect upon the lessons learned during their time at this camp, the takeaways are ultimately surface-level and not delved into. Rather than saying things like \"I had more confidence,\" it would be more engaging to show how that confidence made an effect and what exactly that \"confidence\" meant. This essay touches upon some meaningful lessons, but ultimately they fall flat because the nuances of these lessons are glossed over. Phrases like \"upon further consideration it no longer fills me with...apprehension\" don't delve into the most interesting part: How and why did that fear go away? What changed about your perspective and why? Instead, these are explained away with \"confidence and maturity,\" which are too broad of terms and feel meaningless because they are overused in essays. Use First Names Rather Than Vague Words : In your personal statement, it is completely OK to reference people by their first name. Using names makes your essay more vivid and engaging, while showing a deeper connection that you have with others. Rather than saying \"other people\" or \"one of the older campers,\" it would be more impactful to use their first name. There are some caveats, however. Don't use their name if you're showing them in a negative light (which you probably shouldn't do anyway) or if you're revealing something personal about them. If you are revealing something personal, you can substitute their name for another name, or ask them for their direct permission."
